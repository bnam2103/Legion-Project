# Legion-Project

Legion is an interactive voice-activated chatbot prototype, designed to provide conversational responses or perform web searches based on user queries. It works similarly to voice assistants like Alexa, but with some limitations, as it's still in development.

## Key Features:

- Voice Activation: To start the chatbot, say the keyword "Legion Five".

- Voice Input: After activation, the system listens for voice input using an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) module, which converts spoken words into text.

- Text Processing: The transcribed text is then processed:

  - If the input is a question, it is sent to ChatGPT for a response.

  - If the input is a topic or search query, Selenium is used to search Google for relevant information.

- Text-to-Speech (TTS): Once processing is complete, the system responds using TTS to either announce the search results or provide the answer generated by ChatGPT.

All of these functions are looped in the main program, allowing continuous interaction.

## Note:

This is still a prototype with some feature limitations. A video explaining the working of this project is attached in the repository.
